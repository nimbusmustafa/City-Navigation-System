# City-Navigation-System
This project implements a city navigation system using a grid layout. The grid represents a city map where each cell can be an open path, an obstacle, a traffic-heavy area, or a highway. Users can set current and final destinations, add obstacles, traffic, and highways, and the system will calculate the shortest path using the A* algorithm.
